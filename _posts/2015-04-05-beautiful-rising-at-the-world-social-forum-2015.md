##Participants shared experiences of how to creatively organize for social justice and equality at the 2015 World Social Forum in Tunis. 

“Where is Salle B?” I ask through the torrential downpour of rain. 

“Come with me, I will take you there,” says the Tunisian student volunteer. I follow him through crowds chanting liberation slogans for Palestine and Argentina, past the frozen flash mob of Tunisian students demanding university rights, around the African dancers ringed by smartphone-clad onlookers capturing the moment, and along rows of tables with piles of literature blowing around like confetti in the strong storm winds. We reach the classroom where the workshop is taking place and my guide, a Tunisian engineering student, says, “You are welcome.” 

Getting lost, asking for help, and navigating through a maze of classrooms is a constant activity here at the World Social Forum in Tunis. Despite over 88 pages of workshop listings and information, the Forum guide has no map to the University of Tunis El Manar campus. My frequent bouts of frustration at not being able to find sessions seem to always be interrupted by the presence of one of the friendly students offering to take me wherever I need to go. And that beats following GPS on my cell phone and tripping over the sidewalk on the way. 

Perhaps this is an ample metaphor for the state of many social movements: <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Mapping-Creative-Social-Change-at-the-World-Social-Forum-20150330-0007.html" target="_blank">(read full article...)</a>
