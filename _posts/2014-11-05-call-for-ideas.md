Beautiful Rising is seeking the best examples of game-changing creative activism from the global south - and we need your help!

Share your idea today by [filling out this form](http://goo.gl/forms/ReUsiSJ5FX). 

The global south has long been at the forefront of creative protest tactics and strategies. Beautiful Rising, a partnership between ActionAid and Beautiful Trouble, seeks to document, decode and share these innovations so that others can learn from them and apply them in their own contexts. We’ll not only showcase the best examples of creative activism at work in the global south, but partner directly with grassroots activists to illuminate the principles and practices of effective creative activism in diverse and politically challenging circumstances. For inspiration, here are just a few examples:
 
* A pro-democracy Burmese youth movement uses graffiti stencils and pamphlets to spread messages opposing Myanmar's military government during the Saffron Revolution.

* A Ugandan anti-corruption coalition encourage people to dress in black every Monday to show their opposition to corruption by those in power. This way the movement grows in visibility every week.

BUT — to ensure we draw on as broad a network as possible, we need your ideas. What bold, creative actions, campaigns and movements from across the global south should we showcase?
