Hello again from the team at Beautiful Rising,

We've had a busy winter, and wanted to share our successes with you. Most importantly, we held our first in-country session in Myanmar/Burma, in late January, 2015. You can read more about it, and where we're going next, [here](http://beautifulrising.org/2015/02/17/17-myanmar/).

Also in January, we convened our second advisory network meeting to seek input on the project’s statement of values, and on a creative card game entitled "Cards for Humanity" we're developing for use during the in-country sessions. We also held a preliminary "security bootcamp" for our team and offered a security primer to workshop participants.

January also brought a new member to our team: Theis Dencker. Theis will be contributing to project management on the ActionAid end of things for the next three months, including coordinating our next workshops.


**New Advisory Network members**

We also have some new additions to the Beautiful Rising Advisory Network to announce. Joining our existing advisory network members -- Katharine Ainger, Tom Allen, Laura Walker Hudson, Anna Levy, and Aurelia Moser -- are:
