We'd like to introduce Marcel Taminato, the new co-editor of the forthcoming Beautiful Rising creative activism toolkit for (and by!) organizers and campaigners from across Africa, Asia and Latin America.

He is an anthropologist and social activist, co-founder of Escola de Ativismo (School of Activism) in Brazil and co-editor of the Portuguese edition of Beautiful Trouble ([_Bela Baderna: Ferramentas Para Revolução_](http://beautifultrouble.org/2013/11/19/bt-international-edition-bela-baderna-ferramentas-para-revolucao/)). He has been working with non-profit organizations and social movements across Latin America and Asia for the past ten years. A researcher, editor, and learning facilitator on issues related to non-violent resistance, social and environmental justice, and movement building, Marcel currently lives in Bangkok, where he is doing research on politics and disasters.
