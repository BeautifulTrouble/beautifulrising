# Seeking Co-editor for Online Activist Toolkit

### _Application deadline: August 3, 2015_

Are you passionate about creative activism, radical politics and south-south international solidarity? Do your political networks include community activists at the forefront of feminist, anti-capitalist, and anti-colonial struggles in the global south? Are you a skilled editor with a keen eye for detail, an ability to synthesize complex ideas in accessible language, and a passion for using persuasive language as a tool for social change? This is an opportunity to work with a global constellation of changemakers in developing a toolkit of creative activism for activists from across Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Beautiful Rising is looking for a Co-editor to work with a dispersed team of troublemakers in assigning, writing, editing, and assembling content for an online toolkit to be published in spring 2016. The successful candidate will have:

- substantial experience as both a political writer and a professional editor;
- a keen interest in publishing accessible, engaging, and actionable content for a diverse global readership;
- significant ties to / experience with social movements in the global south;
- a familiarity with creative activism toolkits like Beautiful Trouble, the Global Change Lab, or others;
- a firm grasp of the history, thought, and practices informing radical politics and creative activism across diverse contexts;
- excellent time management, interpersonal, and communication skills, and an ability to work collaboratively across great distances;
- tact, grace, and a generous sense of humour.

This is a part-time, contract position, averaging between 5 and 10 hours per week until the end of March 2016, at US$40/hour, with the possibility of travel to and facilitation of one or more in-country workshops (to be compensated separately).

Please email a resume, cover letter, and sample of recent work to _dave(at) beautifultrouble.org_ by **August 3, 2015.** Only those candidates short-listed for an interview will be contacted.

#### _Beautiful Rising is committed to practicing anti-oppression and south-south solidarity in all aspects of our work. We strongly encourage applications from activists operating at the front lines of multiple, intersecting oppressions, and will prioritize these applicants in all hiring decisions. The successful applicant will either be based in, or have significant ties to, Africa, Asia, or Latin America._
