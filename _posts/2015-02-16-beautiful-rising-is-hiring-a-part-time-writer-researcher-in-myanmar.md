Folks at AA Myanmar asked me to modify the posting based on political sensitivities here. I made the changes in prose, but it's still not letting me submit them. Can one of you tech wizards replace the post with the following modified text? Thanks!


[_Beautiful Rising_](http://beautifulrising.org/), a toolkit of creative activism that will showcase the innovative tactics & strategies of social movements across the global south, is looking for a Myanmar-based writer/researcher to contribute to the project.

The writer/researcher will develop **case studies** for the toolkit over the next few months, in collaboration with the editorial team. These will be similar to [case studies from _Beautiful Trouble_](http://beautifultrouble.org/case/), but will focus on recent creative and innovative actions and organizing in Myanmar specifically. The goal will be to write up these actions and how they were successful so that activists both in Myanmar and in other countries across the global south can learn from them. 

We encourage interested applicants to read a few case studies from our previous toolkit to get a better understanding of the format. For example: 

* [_The Salt March_](http://beautifultrouble.org/case/the-salt-march/)
* [_The Santa Claus Army_](http://beautifultrouble.org/case/santa-claus-army/)
* [_Brazil’s Free Fare Movement_](http://beautifultrouble.org/case/brazils-free-fare-movement/)

The successful applicant will have a strong interest in social movements in Myanmar and a proven proficiency in written English. To apply, please email [_dave@beautifultrouble.org_](mailto:dave@beautifultrouble.org) with a short letter (one page maximum) explaining why you want to write for Beautiful Rising, and attach a writing sample (in English). 

This position pays an honorarium of USD$100 for each case study.

Please apply by **Wednesday February 27**.
