###**Exciting new partnership will support & share lessons from activists in the Global South**

Over the next two years, [ActionAid Denmark](http://www.ms.dk/en) will be partnering with the creative gang of activists behind [Beautiful Trouble](http://beautifultrouble.org) and organisers in rights-based activism and campaigns in **Zimbabwe, Uganda, Myanmar, Bangladesh** and **Egypt**. Together, we'll be developing an online toolkit for activists in the global south to engage in thinking through, and sharing, their most effective strategies for achieving social change.

The project, funded by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) under the heading "Innovative Partnerships," seeks to strengthen the capacity, creativity, and effectiveness of social movements, activist groups, and civil society organizations to achieve lasting social change.
