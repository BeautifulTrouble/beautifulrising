Beautiful Rising is pleased to announce two new workshops to be held in the fall of 2015. We will in Bangladesh from October 4-8, and returning to Africa to visit Uganda from November 9-13. 

Building on the lessons learned from our previous workshops in [Burma](https://beautifulrising.org/2015/02/17/17-myanmar/), [Jordan](https://beautifulrising.org/2015/05/12/troublemaker-s-workshop-in-amman/), and [Zimbabwe](https://beautifulrising.org/2015/06/30/zimbabwe-beautiful-rising-a-recap/), these new workshops will continue providing a space where activists from diverse backgrounds can work together to identify, articulate, and disseminate their practices.

Beautiful Rising will also work with frontline activists in these countries to shape their stories of strategic movement building for our online toolbox of creative activism especially geared for campaigners from across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. (_Coming soon!_)

A call for participants for both workshops will be announced shortly. Check back here for details, or follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BeautifulRising) and Twitter [@BeautRising](https://twitter.com/BeautRising).
