**_Beautiful Rising_** will be a modular toolkit of creative activism assembled by activists, organizers and troublemakers across the global south[^1] and launching August 2016. If you’re involved in innovative, creative activism and want to work with us to document your successes (and failures!) for others to learn from them, **we want to hear from you**.

We are seeking pitches for short, focused entries (ranging from 200 to 1,000 words) on the following:

* **stories** of change and resistance — both successes and failures that illustrate the tools, tactics and principles of effective, creative activism (for example, [activists in Uganda smuggling pigs into Parliament](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/06/uganda-students-smuggle-pigs-into-parliament-2014619135814262144.html)

* effective **tactics** of creative activism (flash mobs, divestment, creative distruption, pots-and-pans protests, etc.)

* insightful **principles** of creative activism (design guidelines of movement building and action planning)

* useful **tools** for strategic campaigning and action planning (e.g. pillars of power, points of intervention, etc.)

* **big ideas** about how the world works and how we change it (direct action, neoliberalism, hegemony, etc.).

##About the project

#####“Like art, revolution is an important dimension of uniquely human activity, a form of species-constitutive behavior that contains its own grammar and logic.”

**_Beautiful Rising_** is convening front-line activists and movements from across the global south to distill the most effective approaches and latest innovations in creative activism. The Beautiful Rising toolbox will launch in August 2016 in a range of online and offline/print formats.

<br/>

**_Beautiful Rising_**, a partnership between ActionAid and Beautiful Trouble, is working directly with activists in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the Middle East/North Africa region, and has convened an Advisory Network of leading practitioners in social movement activism and technology. We aim to showcase the best examples of creative activism at work in the majority world, partnering directly with grassroots activists to help them illuminate the principles, practices and tactics of effective creative activism they have developed — and to disseminate the resulting toolkit to change-makers worldwide.
